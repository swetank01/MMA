## User Stories

Derived from `Roadmap.md` phases/sprints and `Todo.md` architecture. Grouped by domain. Each story is concise; acceptance criteria implied by roadmap; add details in issues as needed.

### API Gateway
1. As a platform admin, I want external traffic routed through an API gateway so that I can centralize TLS termination, routing, and rate limiting.
2. As a developer, I want the gateway to validate request schemas so that malformed requests are rejected before reaching services.
3. As a security engineer, I want the gateway to verify access tokens so that only authorized clients can reach protected endpoints.
4. As an operator, I want blue/green or canary deploys at the gateway so that I can safely roll out changes with minimal risk.

### Authentication & Authorization
5. As a user, I want to sign in and obtain an access token so that I can access protected resources.
6. As a user, I want my token to refresh seamlessly so that my session persists without frequent logins.
7. As a service, I want to authenticate to other services using mTLS or signed service tokens so that inter-service calls are secure.
8. As a security engineer, I want role/permission checks enforced at services so that sensitive operations are properly authorized.

### User Profile
9. As a user, I want to create a profile so that the system can store my preferences and metadata.
10. As a user, I want to view my profile so that I can see my stored information.
11. As a user, I want to update my profile so that I can keep my information current.
12. As a user, I want to delete my profile so that my data is removed upon request.
13. As a developer, I want an OpenAPI-defined user profile API so that clients and tests can rely on a stable contract.

### Product/Catalog
14. As a shopper, I want to browse products so that I can discover items quickly.
15. As a shopper, I want to search and filter products so that I can find relevant items efficiently.
16. As a shopper, I want product pages to load fast so that my experience is responsive even under load.
17. As a catalog manager, I want to add and update products so that the catalog remains accurate.

### Orders & Payments
18. As a shopper, I want to place an order so that I can purchase products.
19. As a system, I want order creation to be idempotent so that duplicate submissions do not create multiple orders.
20. As a payments integrator, I want an event emitted on order creation so that downstream payment processing can be triggered.
21. As a support agent, I want to view an order’s status so that I can assist customers.

### Notifications
22. As a user, I want to receive an order confirmation email so that I have a receipt of my purchase.
23. As a user, I want to receive status updates (e.g., shipped) so that I know the progress of my order.
24. As an operator, I want failed notifications to retry and dead-letter so that transient failures do not lose messages.

### Observability
25. As an SRE, I want service metrics exposed (latency, error rate) so that I can monitor health and SLOs.
26. As an SRE, I want structured JSON logs so that I can query and correlate issues quickly.
27. As an engineer, I want distributed traces across services so that I can diagnose latency and failures end-to-end.
28. As an SRE, I want readiness and liveness probes so that the platform can automate restarts safely.

### Infrastructure & Deployments
29. As a DevOps engineer, I want Helm charts for each service so that I can deploy consistently to Kubernetes.
30. As a DevOps engineer, I want HPAs and PDBs configured so that services scale and remain available during maintenance.
31. As a release manager, I want staging deployments to occur automatically after CI so that testing is consistent.

### CI/CD & Quality
32. As an engineer, I want CI to run linting, tests, and builds on every PR so that code quality remains high.
33. As a QA, I want smoke tests to run after deploys so that critical paths are verified before promotion.
34. As a consumer team, I want contract tests enforced so that API changes don’t break dependents.

### Data & Migrations
35. As a service owner, I want automated schema migrations so that database changes are safe and repeatable.
36. As a DBA, I want regular backups and tested restores so that we can recover from incidents.

### Security & Compliance
37. As a security engineer, I want secrets stored and rotated securely so that credentials are not leaked or stale.
38. As a compliance officer, I want audit logs for sensitive actions so that we can investigate and meet compliance needs.
39. As a platform admin, I want rate limiting and WAF rules at the edge so that abusive traffic is contained.

### Performance & Cost
40. As an SRE, I want load tests with targets per service so that we can validate SLOs.
41. As a finance stakeholder, I want cost per request monitored so that we can optimize spend.

### Developer Experience
42. As a developer, I want a local dev environment (Compose/Tilt) so that I can run and iterate quickly.
43. As a developer, I want API specs and golden examples so that clients and tests are straightforward to implement.
44. As a developer, I want clear runbooks and contribution docs so that onboarding is fast and operations are consistent.
